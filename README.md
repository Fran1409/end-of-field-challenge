# End of field challenge

In this project we had the challenge to recreate some new interfaces. We had three options to choose from. Two simple ones and one complex one. I focused on the simple interface 07 and the complex interface 01.

At the end I had some time left so I began with interface simple 04 but it isnt't pixel-perfect yet.

## Rules

1. This is a solo challenge. And since this is also a test, you are not allowed to ask for help from your fellow juniors this time ãƒ„
You are allowed, of course, to use documentation sites, Google, stackoverflow.com and any other resource that you would normally use. Internet is your friend.
2. You MAY use SASS if it makes the job easier, but it will not give you extra points.
3. You MAT NOT use a CSS framework, nor copy CSS code from a framework.
4. Commit (and push) per feature or part (set a timer to remind you if you need to).
5. If there is anything that you don't understand about this exercise, ask your coach on your promotion's Discord channel!
